# OPC NodeSet2 Server

An [OPC UA .NET Standard Stack](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard) server implementation which is able to easily load NodeSet2 Files and also encodeable types generated by the official OPC Foundation [Model Compiler](https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-ModelCompiler)

## Intention

This project is intended to help other developers to easily check an NodeSet2 information model file in a running server environment using the official OPC .NET Standard Stack Server.

To be more flexible at all, this project uses the DryIoc container to enable IOC with the application.

## What is possible?

- Load NodeSet2.xml Files (Specifications like Machinery, Robotics and so on as well)
- Load Encodeable Types generated by the model compiler of a NodeSet2.xml file.
- Implement Node service types that are able to manipulate nodes or handle method calls (Just inherit the NodeServiceBase and register the type in IOC)
- Implement own types to build up some fancy applications

## Example project

The example project shows how to implement the OPC NodeSet2 Server. An example project can be found in the repository

To Dos

- Create new C# console project >= .NET 8
- Reference the [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Opc.NodeSet2.Server)
- Create an Application.cs and inherit OpcNodeSet2Application
- Watchout the example project
- Have fun!
